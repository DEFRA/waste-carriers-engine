      paragraph_1: Renewing this registration will extend its expiry date to %{date}. There is a charge of £%{renewal_charge} to do this, plus a £%{type_change_charge} charge if you change the registration type.
      paragraph_2: If your business type has changed, for example from sole trader to limited company, you cannot renew and instead must create a new registration.
      paragraph_3: We’ll also check the type of activities you are doing to confirm you still require an upper tier registration. If you don’t you cannot renew and again must create a new lower tier registration.
