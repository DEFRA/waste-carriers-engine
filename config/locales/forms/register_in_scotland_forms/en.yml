      title: You should register in Scotland
      heading: You should register in Scotland
      paragraph_1: Each country has its own register of waste carriers, and you should register with the appropriate authority.
      paragraph_2: In Scotland you need to register with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).
      service_link: Register or renew as a waste carrier or broker (Scotland)
      paragraph_3: You can still continue to register with the Environment Agency in England, but this will make it harder for your customers to check that youâ€™re a registered waste carrier.
      paragraph_4: If you have any questions about this, please contact our helpline on 03708 506 506.
