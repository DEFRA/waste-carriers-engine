      heading: You should register in Northern Ireland
      paragraph_1: Each country has its own register of waste carriers and you are encouraged to register with the appropriate authority for it.
      paragraph_2: In Northern Ireland you need to register with Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA). For details on how, visit
      service_link: Register or renew as a waste carrier, broker or dealer (Northern Ireland)
      paragraph_3: You can still complete the process and register in England with the Environment Agency, but you may find this makes it harder for your customers to verify youâ€™re a registered waste carrier.
      paragraph_4: If you have any questions about this, please contact our helpline on 03708 506 506.
