      paragraph_1: |
        Everyone who produces, manages or handles waste is required to take reasonable measures to prevent
        the risk of other people in the waste chain committing an offence and prevent the risk of an illegal
        deposit. How to do this is detailed in the %{duty_of_care_link} (opens in a new window) and will vary
        based on your relationship to the waste. Failing to take reasonable measures is an offence.
