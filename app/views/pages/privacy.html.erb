      We are allowed to process your personal data because we have official authority as the environmental regulator to register waste carriers, brokers and dealers. The lawful basis for processing your personal data is to exercise our official authority that is set out in law.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      What we do with your personal data
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We use your personal data to process your registration. If you do not provide the information requested, we cannot register you as a Waste carrier, broker or dealer. We do not store payment details. We do not use your personal data to make an automated decision or for automated profiling.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We will use the personal data you provide about criminal convictions to make a decision about whether you can register as a waste carrier. If a person in the company’s management has a relevant unspent criminal conviction, your application to register as a waste carrier could be refused.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We put the name and address of your business or organisation and whether the registration is upper or lower tier, on a public register.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We supply GOV.UK Notify with your name, address and email address so they can send emails and letters to you on our behalf.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We will not share or disclose any other personal data to any party outside the Environment Agency unless we are lawfully able to do so.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      How long we keep your personal data
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Information you enter in the Waste Carriers, Brokers and Dealers registration service is saved until you decide to submit it. This allows you to save what you are doing and continue later. Saved information that you do not submit will be deleted after 30 days.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      After you submit your information for an upper-tier registration, we will keep your personal data for 7 years after a registration has ended.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Lower-tier registrations are non-expiring. If you need to cancel your registration, please contact the Environment Agency helpline on 03708 506 506. We will then retain your personal data for 7 years after you have cancelled your registration.
