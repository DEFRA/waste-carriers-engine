# github_changelog_generator makes an API request per merged PR just to find its
# merge commit, which hits GitHub's rate limits. These changes override the gem
# methods to take advantage of the fact that the merge commit is already in
# the pull requests list it fetches, so use that instead. See the gem's own note:
# https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator/blob/5a0cbdb6860ffc449e838541faf3f24e10d75722/lib/github_changelog_generator/generator/generator_fetcher.rb#L69
#
# The back and front office apps load this file too.

  # Instead of fetching every PR's events, give each PR just the "merged" event
  # the gem reads. Assumes no plain GitHub issues, which our repos don't use.
